# twhitbeck's dotfiles

I typically run the latest version of Ubuntu. This repo is how I bootstrap
a fresh install. This is not meant to be prescriptive but rather descriptive.
It's also not an automated setup script but more of a choose your own adventure,
because what I like might not suit your needs or fit your tastes, and I'm always
reevaluating my choices.
